In this draft you will here a car engine starting and then the sounds of the road and driving throughout the subsequent conversation. 
I wanted the feel of a car ride while not having the car audio be too distracting from the connversation ensuing.
In the car you will hear a mother and a daughter. A classic tale of the mother insisiting that the two will ONLY be looking
at kittens and absolutely not taking one home. The daughter is very excited and makes the mom promise to tell her eveything about
the cats. This should be the readers first clue that the daughter is visually impaired. The pair will then walk the parking lot 
of the animal shelter and enter via a shop door adorned with a bell.
I am hoping to create from here a feeling of anticipation and wonderment for the little girl.
